# dcc:document

The element document contains the human readable variant of the DCC.

All further information and files agreed between the customer and the calibration laboratory can be inserted into this element. Files of various types (e.g. results from spreadsheet programs) are converted using the Base64 method [^1] so that they can be stored in the XML structure. They can then be removed from the XML structure and converted back without errors using the Base64 method.
